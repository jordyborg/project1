# FIFA Street Skillers

## About the website
- This is a database created to some of my personal Favourite football players, and to intergrate them into the world of Street-Football. 
- Street soccer is a popular form of soccer that is played in urban areas, and it attracts some of the world's best players. These players often have exceptional ball control, quick reflexes, and impressive footwork.
- They are known for their creativity and improvisation, as the unpredictable nature of the game demands it. Street soccer players are often smaller in stature, but they compensate with their agility, balance, and speed.
- These players are adept at playing in a small area, using walls, curbs, or other objects as barriers to showcase their skills. They are confident and fearless, unafraid to take on multiple defenders at once, and have a strong sense of team play.

## Technology used
- Ruby on Rails
- HTML 
- CSS 
- Bootstrap
- Cloudinary
- Javascript

## Successful features
- You are able to add, edit and delete from the Database of both Teams and Players.

## ___Unsuccessful___  features
- During the process of this project, I was able to get all the pages I wanted to work, to work. 
In the final stages I had made some changes, which disrupted the flow of the website. 
I was unable to pin-point where exactly where the issue was coming from, essentially it was to hide the toolbar of the project for non-signed in users. 
- I was unable to get images implemented on the Seed.data for the 'Teams' logo, I used the same method as I did for 'Players' and this was successful. 
- CSS will be the death of me.
