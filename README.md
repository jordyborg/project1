# FIFA Street Skillers

## Successful features
- You are able to add, edit and delete from the Database of both Teams and Players.

## ___Unsuccessful___  features
- During the process of this project, I was able to get all the pages I wanted to work, to work. 
In the final stages I had made some changes, which disrupted the flow of the website. 
I was unable to pin-point where exactly where the issue was coming from, essentially it was to hide the toolbar of the project for non-signed in users. 
- I was unable to get images implemented on the Seed.data for the 'Teams' logo, I used the same method as I did for 'Players' and this was successful. 
- CSS will be the death of me.
